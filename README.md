By systematically analyzing this data, we seek to uncover actionable insights that can inform product improvements, marketing strategies, and customer service enhancements for Beats By Dre.

## Data Sources:

The dataset for this EDA was collected by scraping reviews from Amazon using a web scraper, but due to Amazonâ€™s anti-web scraping policy, we were limited to obtaining 100 reviews per product.

## Insights :

The analysis shows that while most products are well-regarded, variability in sentiment, especially during August 2024, reveals some dissatisfaction among consumers with the Beats pill standing firm amongst other speakers.

## Business recommendations :

Beats by Dre should maintain the strengths of the Beats Pill in design, sound quality, and portability while addressing performance issues at higher volumes and button functionality. Investigating the August 2024 spike in negative reviews is crucial. Exploring innovations like enhanced battery life and rugged designs could further strengthen the product's market position.
