Beats Pill,149.95,18,Red,2024-07-01,5,"Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!",True
Beats Pill,149.95,0,Gold,2024-09-05,5,"Very HappyWe bought this for a trip to the beach and it did not disappoint. Quick easy connection to our phones, good sound quality, solid build and long battery life. We have since found ourselves grabbing it instead of our existing outdoor speakers for using on the back patio. One feature we did not think we would use but really like is the speaker phone function. It is really nice for conversations with family that multiple people want to be involved in. Better then iPhone speaker phone alone.",True
Beats Pill,149.95,8,Gold,2024-07-11,5,"The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.",True
Beats Pill,149.95,7,Red,2024-07-08,5,"Really goodSo I‚Äôm super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.",True
Beats Pill,149.95,5,Black,2024-07-23,4,"Is it the JBL killer?I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could‚Äôve went with Champagne as well and would‚Äôve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.",True

Beats Pill,149.95,6,Black,2024-07-02,3,"Good design, but bass distortionThe new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....",True
Beats Pill,149.95,3,Black,2024-08-13,4,"Almost perfectI bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!",True
Beats Pill,149.95,0,Gold,2024-08-15,4,"No App for IOS. No way to disable loud startup/poweroff tonesLove these speakers, but Apple seemed to have made a bit screw up.The speaker makes a very loud startup and power down sound. NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple. Hope they will get around someday to updating or creating a new app or just add this functionality inside the existing IOS to support disabling of these tones.",True

Beats Pill,149.95,0,Black,2024-09-04,5,"One of the Best Compact Portable SpeakersI picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were ‚ÄúHow is this going to sound?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill this live up to its price?‚Äù & ‚ÄúHow good is the build quality?‚Äù. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the ‚ÄúStatement Red‚Äù as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this speaker.",False

Beats Pill,149.95,12,Black,2024-06-28,4,"Bass HeavyAs you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.",False
Beats Pill,149.95,1,Black,2024-07-10,4,"Not bad for the priceI own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.",False
Beats Pill,149.95,1,Black,2024-07-01,5,"Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ androidThis is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.",False

Beats Pill,149.95,1,Red,2024-07-13,5,"The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.",False

Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet. I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor.Fast forward to 2024, and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model. You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict? A triumphant return for the Beats Pill üî•",False

Beats Pill,149.95,0,Black,2024-06-30,5,"HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you.

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,255,Black,2024-05-04,5,"Simply great.I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.",True

Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,26,Green,2024-07-18,4,"Small speaker, big sound, travel friendlyGot this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me. Now let‚Äôs see if the battery life is legit. I‚Äôll check back in.",True
Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,121,Black,2024-07-02,5,"A premium speaker in a sturdy package.I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",True
Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,0,White,2024-09-03,5,"Way better than expected!The last time I tried Bose speakers was about 25 years ago and I swore them off completely because I didn't like their signature sound. After reading all of the glowing reviews and watching many, many speaker reviews on YT, I decided to give the Soundlink Flex a try as a replacement for my aging Sony SRS-X3. I initially purchased the Beosound A1 (2nd Gen), which has superior mid and high sound quality IMO, but had to return because the it was very underpowered. Where the Flex can easily fill a 500 sq ft space, the A1 provided incredibly low sound at a distance of 15 ft. The Flex puts out more bass, if not more than the A1, and the bass offers more punch at lower Hz than the A1. The overall sound is great for the price but would be really nice if the app included an equalizer to help push up the mids and highs.Prior to purchasing the Flex on Amazon and trying to save a buck, I bought the Flex SE from Costco thinking it was the same product that was just repackaged. After 15 minutes of trying to use as a speakerphone, I finally figured out that the SE does not have a built-in microphone and therefore cannot be used as a speakerphone. So, I immediately returned the SE and bought the non-SE here.",True
Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,26,Purple,2024-06-15,5,"5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êOMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.",True
Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,2,Black,2024-07-22,4,"Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveatsBought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.",True

No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone.

Bose SoundLink Flex,149.0,4,White,2024-07-23,3,"there‚Äôs a time and place for it!I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

JBL CHARGE 5,179.95,29,Black,2024-05-30,5,"Amazing Sound and Great DurabilityThe media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you‚Äôre an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint. Highly recommended!",True
JBL CHARGE 5,179.95,79,Black,2024-04-05,5,"INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)",True
JBL CHARGE 5,179.95,1,Green,2024-08-10,5,"So far, absolutely amazing.I owned several different brands and sizes of speakers. I recently bought this JBL Charge 5 (new) and I couldn't be more pleased. The sound quality and quantity of the sound you get from this size of speaker is outstanding! I literally have been using it for 24hrs straight on medium volume and it's still at 80%!! It's got the JBL toughness with the Harmon performance. It looks great and works even better. I've had no issues with connectivity, even through several walls of my house it still plays the audio like I'm right there.Get a refurbished one: You will not find a speaker that's got these qualities for this price. I suggest getting a refurbished one from Amazon and save $60.

I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have.

JBL CHARGE 5,179.95,22,White,2023-12-15,3,"Audio Engineers point of viewI purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.",True

JBL CHARGE 5,179.95,3,Black,2024-02-19,5,Great little speakersSo let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!!,True

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,61,Black,2021-10-24,5,"Tribit Stormbox Pro Versus Bose Soundlink Revolve.I have both of these speakers and am offering a comparison. These are my opinions for what they‚Äôre worth. The bottom line is that the Tribit Stormbox Pro is a better value than the Bose Soundlink Revolve.Sound:Both of these speakers provide excellent room-filling sound that is decidedly different. The Bose is more ambient with a mono feel, which it is. The bass and mid-range are good but there is very little in the way of high treble. For example, you probably won't hear that classic ""ping"" in middle of ""Comfortably Numb"". Bose, being Bose, provides no information about what is inside the casing. My guess is that there is one woofer and a single transducer.Tribit, on the other hand, emits more of a surround sound which actually seems stereophonic. Bass is thumping amazing with the booster on, mid-range is fine and and very high notes come through loud and clear. Some reviewers describe this as ""Tinny""; I don't think so. Tribit openly discloses that there is a subwoofer, 2 transducers and 2 passive radiators.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. At lower volume, the sound quality is equal. Tribit wins at moderate to high volume with the Extra Bass activated.Functionality:Bose has 5 control buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, volume + and -, and one more which I haven‚Äôt figured out but things get messed up whenever I push it. An audio cable port is provide if you can‚Äôt connect via Bluetooth for some reason. The optional Bose charging cradle is the worst accessory ever designed in history - don‚Äôt waste your money. Bose rates the speaker as IP55 water resistant.Tribit has 4 buttons (Power, Bluetooth pairing, and volume + and -). The Tribit also shows battery power. The Stormbox Pro has a carrying strap which is a great idea; I‚Äôve dropped my Bose a couple times. Tribit rates the speaker as IP67 water proof.ADVANTAGE: Tribit. The controls are simpler.Price:Right now, the Bose Soundlink Revolve (Series II) is $219 and the Tribit Stormbox Pro is $119.95 with a 20% coupon ($95.96).ADVANTAGE: Tribit. Bose is over-priced.Appearance:The Bose exterior is solid plastic and durable. Tribit has a high-quality fabric exterior and looks good. The Stormbox is 1‚Äù higher than the Revolve.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Battery:I‚Äôve never had an issue with my Bose‚Äôs battery. The manufacturer claims 13 hours of playtime. Tribit claims to provide 24 hours of play time and has a port for charging your cell phone.ADVANTAGE: Equal.Durability:One thing you have to hand to Bose, their products are built to last. Despite the fact I cannot attest to the Tridbit's durability - Bose gets the vote.Advantage: BoseSummary:The Tribit Stormbox Pro is an amazing portable speaker at under $100. It meets or beats the Bose SoundLink Revolve in all categories. I don‚Äôt know how it would match up against the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ with runs $329.",True
Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,0,Black,2024-06-05,5,"A Perfect Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for your Laptop or TabletMy wife and I are semi-retired and this purchase was for home use and our review was not in exchange for money or a seller's payment. We rarely leave reviews unless our purchase was something we found excellent with great value. We have purchased 4 portable speakers to connect to our Dell 7200 2-in-1 which is a tablet and laptop. The factory sound is weak, flat an horrible and is not worth seeing a movie online. We have tried both a sound bar and aux. speaker. Most provided a wireless bluetooth and a wired connection. The Tribit's bluetooth was easy, stable and remains connected without issue or having to re-connect like our other bluetooth speakers. The sound is awesome, clear and distortion free. Our music taste goes from blues, jazz, soft rock and classical. Our movies vary. But this speaker sounds better at reproducing sound with much higher volume that is clear and sharp with little to distortion. The sound with only one speaker fills the room like a surround sound speaker system. We decided to purchase a 2nd Speaker and it was suggested. Today, I am very happy when my purchase exceeds my expectations as the Tribit did. With a discount and coupon our cost was only $95 and this was the best money we ever spent on a laptop speaker!!!

So, I'm no audiophile, no schooling to know notes and ranges or frequencies, just know when it is at 100 volume, is it distorted, does the bass give out at every hit if battery is half dead (Sony Bluetooth Speakers), and a few other important things I must have in a speaker such as; distance before the karate chopping the song to death starts, can it charge my phone as well (at a speed of 1.5a or higher if that even has hit a speaker yet), MAH capacity has to be 3000 or higher, portability is important, weather resistant is minor, I'm 45 and no longer desire to be with homies regardless of weather conditions or at a beach I'm black so I'm straight, I'll keep my ass indoors if it rains and pool parties was 20 years ago ipwhatever is only for my phone. Speaker who gives two turds, as long as it hits those marks I'm hella happy. Here we are and where this bad boy/girl ranks in my list of yompers.My list of amazing speaks/yompers1. Soundcore Select Pro: absolutely hands down best of it's class by a Seattle Slew distance. Price is unbeatable at 55 dollars during December, regular 90 dollars. Reason you don't see it on Amazon, cause soundcore realized they sold it at a way to cheap price and rebranded it with the motion boom, motion boom is second but the select Pro is by far all around number 1 which includes any JBL Bose Sony or pick one, soundcore nailed it.2. Motion boom soundcore: same as select Pro but more money and bigger battery. Oh they charge devices at the Anker iq speed, since soundcore is Anker, makes since.3. Oontz: damn brilliant design, first to do it triangular and the price point is beyond mi dblowing. My first was the smallest one, I ran down stairs demanded my wife stop her job and hear this little walkey sized speaker, not bunch of bass but clarity and loudness unmatched, 20 dollars and 69 for the biggest one and get 2 of the biggest one they make and they just passed soundcore due to stereo sound and only 120 and you have a speaker, really 2 that sound studiesqe.4. This speaker. Almost a tie with oontz big boy but the price of this one has me putting it 4. Had it been more like 49, number 1.5, soundcore is top dawg for awhile just cause of the app and everything involved. This speaker though is super attractive, chicks come up to just want to hold it, sometimes I gotta ask what it is that they want to hold cause I forget I have in hand cause it's not charge (JBL) heavy or awkward like the many out there. It sounds on par with the megaboom 2 from ue. Not as much bass but the 360 and the clarity is beautiful and filling if starving to hear a rap song like some pac that you just need to hear the message, the best is nice but days the message is what matters and this speaker is that speaker.I could go on on and on, frankly that's to much texting and if my lady knew I wrote this much I be hung immediately and divorced while hanging. So I gotta go but I hope my grammar and structure wasn't to over the place but I'm trying to write and ensure snoop wifey wife don't snoop over my shoulder and say, "" oh ok I see, so when I get a bae I'm drivn and I know you parked at the store cause I followed you, but you can opinionize on a yomper, boi you foul"" so yeah. Ya dig and I'm out",True
Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,6,Black,2023-07-07,4,"*positive update* older version of storm box speaker doesnt pair with the upgraded model7/26/23 update:mona from tribit customer service reached out and kindly arranged for an authentic older version of this speaker to be shipped to me direct from their warehouse and so far, the stereo pairing works great and the speakers sound amazing.sound quality is 6 stars out of 5, build quality is also 5/5 stars. battery life is a solid 4/5-these bad boys put out 40 watts each and last at least 8-9 hours. the one snag is bluetooth connectivity; id give these a 3.5/5 unfortunately. i feel the sound quality makes up for it completely but it is annoying when the right or left channel disconnects or goes out of synch with the other speaker when standing in between the speakers or turning the volume up or down. this is a general issue i've experienced with all kinds of tribit bluetooth speakers i have around my house so, if having to turn your speakers on and off in the middle of listening session is a deal breaker you may have to step up to a higher tier of brand.i have them set up in my large family room for music and podcasts and the smaller tribit stormbox go's on my desk connected to my macbook and ipad and i'm very happy with these speakers and this brand. the sound fills the room and the subwoofers are a nice addition.original review:after a year of using this speaker, taking it back and forth to europe and los angeles, using it at the beach, in the bathroom, as a speaker for a TV, laptop, etc, i bought a second 'upgraded' one since i'm so satisfied with the product. i cant wait to pair them together and see how the stereo sounds. it's loud but the bass can be too much sometimes so, play with the volume on your device and speaker to find the right balance you personally prefer. my one friend with the a bose competition speaker without returned her $220 speaker for this one and she's happy with it.UPDATE:down from 5 stars to 3. the 'upgraded' version of the stormbox pro does not pair with the older model i bought ONLY A YEAR AGO. the brand doesn't mention this in its listing; you have to search ""stereo pairing"" in the 'answered questions' section on the amazon page of the upgraded version and the older version doesn't even exist anymore on their official website. very disappointing and shady.the upgraded speaker also sounds slightly muddier and muffled compared to the older version; that can be the space I have the speaker in or the music i listen to but, having both speakers next to me and switching the same devo song between the two, there was a noticeable difference.is this upgraded version still a very good bluetooth speaker worth the price in comparison with its competition? yes.is it loud and really high quality? absolutelyam i still satisfied with the older version i purchased a year ago? definitely. I'm riding that thing til the wheels fall off lol.did i return it? yes. i need two stereo speakers for my personal desk and I do not want nor need to purchase two brand-new, overpowered, 40w bluetooth speakers.",True
Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,2,Black,2024-07-07,5,"Great sound, great valueI originally had speakers running from an indoor stereo to a pair of outdoor speakers. I redid my outdoor patio area and built a gazebo and was looking to simplify things. I bought a pair of these speakers. Two speakers will pair for stereo sound (left/right channels). I installed hooks into the gazebo rafters and the rubber handles are perfect for hanging them. They sound great. They have been pairing easily without fail since the spring. Once I paired the first time, all I need to do is power them on within proximity of one another for them to enter into stereo mode. Really happy with battery life as well. It would be nice if there was a way to place them into ‚Äústandby mode‚Äù that would enable you to power them on from your phone as opposed to physically having to press the button to turn them on. Again, since I have these hanging up, having to take them down to power them on is a slight inconvenience that I didn‚Äôt have to deal with when I was utilizing my WiFi enabled stereo receiver.

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,0,Black,2024-06-09,5,Simply AmazingI don‚Äôt often write reviews but this amazing little speaker has some features that make it stand out from the crowd. Several are not mentioned until you read the instruction pamphlet.Like all the others reviews I agree this speak isounds amazing. I have the Bose revolve and the range from the deep base to crystal clear highs are better than the Bose. That is saying a lot as the Bose is one of the best speakers on the marketBut what really sets this apart is three awsome features that I didn‚Äôt even know about when I purchased this speaker. I love that you can have two Bluetooth connections at the same time! Now my wife and I can be paired and take turns playing songs.Then I discovered that if you buy a second Tribit StormBox Pro you can sync them to play in Party mode ( same sound from each for putting into a second room) or play them in stereo mode where one speaker plays the left channel and the other plays the right channel!!With all these features and great sound to also be waterproof makes this speaker the clear choice amongst the many choices in portable speakers.,True
Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,4,Black,2024-04-09,5,"Needs some adjustments for best soundsFirst of all, this speaker looks and feels premium. I'm gonna go straight to sound quality part. Right out of box, the sound can turn off most people, including me. I almost put the speaker back in the box and returned it. The xbass feature makes very little difference in bass output. Let me put it this way. This speaker is for people who like flat and clean sound. However, after I downloaded the app, the equalizer makes huge improvements. When making adjustments on equalizer, the midrange and highs can be notably different by just tweaking 1 to 2 dbs. Nevertheless, for the bass, you have to tweak 5 to 6 DBS to hear the difference. The bass does not get booming. It's always clean and musical. This speaker is not for bassheads. The bass sounded muddy and almost distorted at the beginning. However, after few days of listening, the bass improved a lot. It got punchier and almost no distortion even at high volume. The overall sound is now balanced and transparent. I compared it to my bose SoundLink. To me, this speaker made bose sounded like there is a curtain in front of it. In conclusion. I am very happy with this purchase. For the price, it's very high value speaker",True

I decided to upgrade to this particular one and unfortunately the sound is somewhat lacking despite the modern design. The bass is too deep and you need to have the volume up to get a balanced sound. Only thing I can give it is the fact that you can hear almost every sound in the song, it perfectly separates the sounds. I wonder if its one of those speakers where you need two of them to achieve that perfect sound.*Was going to give it 3 stars but realized that the audio I was testing with wasnt good, its not as bad as i thought but still not as balanced as the Tribit MaxSound Plus.",True

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,14,Black,2023-05-16,4,"Great for such a small speaker (just manage your expectations).Update:This is a really good sounding and substantially built speaker. Why are people pathologically obsessed with overwhelming and intrusive bass? (and why do people keep spelling it ‚Äúbase‚Äù?)My only gripe with this speaker (and just about any good Bluetooth speaker) is the uneven response when turned up. Reviewers blather on and on about how great the bass is without any consideration for even, clean, sound reproduction. I am a rock musician so I like loud bass but I also like to hear the mids and highs as well. Given the size of these speakers there is just so much bass that can be cranked through them and still sound good. The good thing about 60 watts of power is that - even though I can only put the speaker at about 70-80 percent before the bass starts overwhelming the mids and highs - it is still pretty loud for my needs.This is a good speaker but, like most speakers, it just tries too hard to be bass heavy and not smooth and even.Original review:I really like the way this speaker sounds at low to middle volume. At that level the bass has an impressive level and it‚Äôs tight sounding. I would have given this speaker a full five stars if the EQ in the app was useful. There aren‚Äôt enough bands of adjustment on the EQ and it doesn‚Äôt hold the settings. The EQ is also not designed to show you exactly what sound profile is active at any time. Like I mentioned, turned up to about 40-50% the sound is very good. This sucker gets loud. Once one goes over 50% volume the upper mids to the high end start to get very harsh. I find that higher than 50% that killing the bass boost helps a lot. The speakers sound evens out quite a bit when you take off the bass boost at higher volumes. 60 watts of output power doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Äúlouder‚Äù than a 40 watt amp, there is just more headroom. I never push any sound device past 80-ish percent because going past that on any speaker/amp or on any sound system is just asking for trouble and disappointment. At 80% the sound is acceptable with the bass boost off. Remember the size of this thing. It‚Äôs definitely not a hip-hop thumper bumper. Killing the bass boost actually does make really loud volume sound better. Before I gave up on the EQ in the app I was able to even out the response at higher volume nicely it‚Äôs a custom profile. The inability to know what preset was active, and the tendency of the EQ to not even change from one sound profile to another was also annoying. I don‚Äôt need to connect 100 speakers or have a rave in my backyard or ever use this on a sandy beach so this speaker works very well sitting on the counter in my bathroom. Overall a very good purchase at the price for my use.",True

And if that wasn‚Äôt good enough. The size and portability of it. Big enough to fit even in a purse with a little bit of wiggle room, and if that doesn‚Äôt say enough it‚Äôs about 7 inches.

Comparing to their competing brands holy cow this is worth every single penny, I think you can notice how much I love this speaker at this point üòÇ because I really do especially like a music fanatic like me you want to hear even the littlest of details and this speaker treats that like waking up and drinking cold water in the middle of the night.

The extra bass boost button absolutely pumps up that bass ! I love the the carrying handle too. Very strong thick rubber.

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,5,Black,2022-01-26,3,"OK for the price range its in but definitely not a B&O.I purchased this speaker along with the Bang and Olufsen Beosound A1 2nd Gen. I was looking for a decently portable water resistant speaker for use around the house and while on vacation. I rolled the dice on the Tribit StormBox Pro because the smaller StormBox Micro has a great review on WhatTheHifi. My criteria were USB C, long battery life 15+ hours, IP67, bluetooth 5 or greater, and AAC support for Apple Hifi.The StormBox Pro sounds like every other midlevel bluetooth speaker (i.e. JBL Flip 5, Sony XB23). It is definitely loud but the sound lacks refinement. It outputs the same sound level at approximately 40% volume as the Beosound outputs at 70%. However, the audio sounds like it is coming out of a can. The enclosure definitely influences the sound. With the B&O you just hear the music and it sounds spacious. The soundstage separates the individual instruments. With the StormBox everything sounds on top of one another. Fine details get lost. If you are wanting to listen to Top 40 super loud at the pool or the beach then the StormBox will be fine. It will have better battery life and you don't have to worry about your $200 speaker walking off or breaking. Plus you can buy two StormBoxes for the price of the B&O.When it comes to deciding between the Tribit and a JBL or Sony it will come down to battery life, size, weight, and if you prefer having an app to change settings like Sony has. I think the sound on all three will be close enough. Flossy Carter has a great review of the SoundBox Pro vs the Flip 5 on YouTube. He also reviews the Beosound.One last note concerning Bluetooth performance. I was looking forward to a range increase from 4.2 devices to 5.0+ devices. I tested the range of an older 4.2 speaker against the StormBox Pro 5.2 and Beosound 5.1. All three speakers started to break up around the same area of my house within a few feet so 5.0+ isn't life changing. Perhaps the transmission quality and battery efficiency are better but I have no way to test that. As a side note, my Airpods 3 performed the best range wise going about 10 feet further than all three bluetooth speakers.",True

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,0,Black,2022-01-29,5,"Great for TV satellite speaker setupLooking for an easy solution to add a satellite speaker to my older Vizio sound bar so that the living room TV could be heard easily in the kitchen, I purchased an Avantree Bluetooth transmitter receiver. The idea was to use the optical passthrough function on the Avantree unit and broadcast the TV sound signal to a portable Bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, most Bluetooth speakers (including Bose) use low quality Bluetooth codecs, which result in enough delay that there was an annoying echo when the Bluetooth speaker and TV speakers were both on. This speaker uses the aptx codec, which has a low latency mode with nearly no delay. I can now have the tv volume at a reasonable low level, and have the Stormbox in the kitchen while cooking or cleaning up, each with independently adjustable volumes. As the Avantree can connect to two devices, I'll probably buy another unit to hack together a whole house sound system for about $300 total.Alone on a flat surface, the speaker sounds okay, but thin. Because of the way sound works, no matter the claims of any speaker brand, speaker cones need to move a lot of air to sound good. No small speaker will ever sound as good as a large multi speaker cabinet. Because I'm pairing this to a sound bar with a woofer, the tinny sound is supplemented by the woofer just fine, and spoken lines from movies and vocals from music actually stand out a little more, which is a good thing in my situation.The Stormbox isn't as pretty as the Bose equivalent, but its laughably better in every other way, for less than half the price.",True

Tribit StormBox Pro,119.99,8,Black,2022-12-09,3,"Didn't suck but not the eye opener the original was.....I kept looking for a reason to keep this speaker but I simply couldn't come up with one. I bought the original Stormbox 4 years ago and it blew me away with the vibrancy and dimensionality I heard, all of it complimented with a bass that punched above its weight. So here it is 2022 and I figured I'd check out the Pro. I expected more of the same, only bigger. That's not happened. Immediately you'll see that the outside of the Pro has more of a clothy feel to it all over.And that's exactly what wrong with speaker.Everything I loved about the original Stormbox is gone in the Pro. The vibrancy is gone, the dimensionality and separation is gone and the music sounds like its trying to come through fabric, robbing the music of its highs and mids. The app was finicky and not intuitive at all. It was hard to work the EQ and I could hardly hear any impact. I was hearing performance in the original; in the Pro, it seems like I was just hearing music coming out of a radio.What you do get with the Pro, however, is much more big, honkin' bass. And, yes, it does get mighty loud. And the bass, even at this size, still punches above weight.Now that's not to say the sound had too much bass but it could've stood to be a bit tighter (but at this price point that's wishful thinking). The amount of bass was fine but I really wanted the mids and highs and dimensionality to come out and join the party as well as they did so much better in the original.This will be a return.",True

Those are hideous, and literally make perfectly good devices useless regularly.‚Ä¢The type-c port they‚Äôve added is a long awaited addition to their Stormbox Pro speaker.All my Tribit speakers have had superb sound quality to similarly priced competitor brands. This also holds true for the Stormbox Pro model.But T here is one annoying little quirk that keeps me from giving the five stars I really wish I could give. Maybe it‚Äôs just my speaker but‚Ä¢the volume from third to fourth press increases pretty drastically. I consistently have to either struggle to hear or have it at an uncomfortable volume.

After a break in period of about 6 weeks, I can say the sound on these things ( I purchased 2) is excellent and the soundstaging and audio imaging out of 2 of these is way better than all the Bluetooth speakers I've had and or listened to within their class. Believe me these things purch WAAAYYY above their weight!! The highs are crisp without being harsh and mids are clearly defined. The bass response is surprisingly good given the units relatively dimutive size and delivers clean smooth tone. No, it's not going to shatter your windows kinda bass but great nonetheless ( especially with extra bass button enabled). I live in an apartment and as such have never had these things past about 50 % volume and I can tell you if I turned them up any louder the neighbors would call the cops on me!!! These speakers get extremely LOUD!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!So in summary: If you're looking for a great speaker/s at an affordable price, these are a must have and a total win!

I‚Äôve used it several days prior, multiple times per day and it‚Äôs much louder. I will say the bass won‚Äôt work well in certain settings. Example, in my house the bass sounds non existent. In a workout room or larger open areas it sounds much better.So I have a 2nd generation Amazon echo. We use it to listen to music while working out at our house. The sound from the echo has always been surprisingly good, with solid bass for such a small speaker. I think the echo has a 2.5 inch woofer and a smaller tweeter in it. I was hoping to upgrade from it since we got it in 2017. This speaker honestly isn‚Äôt really close to that echo bass wise. Clarity wise, the Stormbox sounds good. I‚Äôve listened to it for a day so far and I‚Äôm disappointed. Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but a speaker from 2017 shouldn‚Äôt sound just as good or slightly better than this speaker I feel like. Im not a huge audiophile pr anything like that, I just wanted something that had some kick. If that‚Äôs what you want, this probably isn‚Äôt for you.

For instance, if the volume is on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the lowest audible volume, the volume jumps from a 2 to a 5 with just 1 increase of your phone's volume adjustment. This happens with any phone or app and with both speakers. I emailed Tribit support and they said these are high volume speakers so the overall volume is loud. That doesn't make sense as my car and home audio are significantly louder but have the ability to fine tune lower volume levels.Why is this an issue? We camp and travel a lot and play music by the fire after the kid's go to sleep, and the low volume is barely audible, but then increase it 1 notch and the volume is too loud for quiet hours, there needs to be more steps of adjustment in-between.

The problem with the Doss is that it doesn't get loud enough for me. The Tribit solves that problem, has really nice bass and sounds pretty clear.

The Pro was no doubt a nicer looking much louder speaker with audio output that was clear at high and low volume. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. However, because I've owned the former Stormbox speaker/s for a couple years, I find that the bass reproduction even with bass boost activated on the Pro, low and high volume in my humble opinion was subpar in comparison.

BUGANI,129.99,12,Black,2024-05-22,5,"Could use a fast charge option.Rugged portable speaker, loud enough for outdoor use. I have an installed outdoor stereo with great speakers. It requires a dedicated app and my wife gets frustrated trying to use it. This works directly off of our smartphones, with whatever streaming service, or with the music files stored on your phone.The battery takes a while to charge if you run it out. A quick charge battery option wold be great. The ""TF"" (micro SD memory card) option works great, but as near as I can tell, you have no way to select what plays. It just runs through the card in order. A party mix SD card, would be a great, and easy way, to provide mobile music. I tried several open source, and lossless file formats, and unbelievably, it played them. I'm sure it would play those nearly worthless (IMHO) .mp3 files too. Two woofer speakers, and two tweeter speakers, up front. There is two things on the back, people are calling ""sub-woofers"". I believe they are actually, mass loaded passive (bass) radiators. That is an improvement over a ported enclosure (not waterproof) or a sealed air suspension cabinet (inefficient). I have no idea if they are ""optimized"" for the bass drivers, and phase coherency, but they do add the bass punch people like for dance parties. Sounds better than most ""boom boxes"", and simple to pair and play. Audiophile quality? Not even close, for critical high definition playback, in a controlled environment. They are not made (or priced) for that. Mobile music with an outdoor amplified vibe, and extra bass, that is what this Bluetooth audio appliance does well. With an equalizer application, you can adjust the sound coloration, and turn the volume down, for ambient background music indoors. Very nice for the price, especially compared to some of the other more compact, Bluetooth, battery powered, mobile speakers that mumble something barely recognizable as music. The only inconsistency I discovered with mine so far is: The book says the charging indicator LED, (NOT the front upper left status LED) will switch from red to blue when the battery is at 100%. Mine does not, it goes from solid red to blinking red. As someone else explained, you can check the battery state of charge, with the Bluetooth app on your smart phone, once you are paired.",True

BUGANI,129.99,63,Black,2021-03-07,5,"Mini King Kong! Great for bassThe media could not be loaded. I uploaded a video of the speaker playing BASS HEAVY hiphop. I read at least 50 reviews before buying this to try and see how trap music was, but all I saw were reviews talking about rock, pop, etc.. and the videos that were up had songs with light bass playing. This was a very random purchase after I remembered I lost my Oontz XL and I figured why not get a new speaker for future trips.. I was hesitant due to the name as I had never heard about Bugani before but I saw all the great reviews. I was initially going to buy the 50W model but read that there were no tweeters on that one. I'm very satisfied with my purchase though, 40W is plenty enough. This speaker is kind of chunky like a small toolbox, but it's very light/looks clean- and most importantly, VERY LOUD. I had the speaker on max volume with my phone on max as well and there was no distortion at all! The woofers in the back shake like crazy just like a real subwoofer lol. Even with bass heavy songs, there was a clear distinction between the highs/vocals and the bass; none of the songs I played sounded muddled. PERFECT for blasting music at a party indoors, I had it playing and went down the hall and it was still loud enough. PERFECT for Vegas to turn up in the hotel before going out (which is what I used my last speaker for 90% of the time üòÇ). I've heard a variety of different speakers, all the main brand name ones that every 80s/90s babies have.. this speaker is EASILY in the $150, maybe even $200 class of speakers. VERY LOUD is only good when you can actually hear the song without worrying about blowing out the woofers. If you bump hiphop as your main choice of music, you will NOT be disappointed!! I opened the box very carefully, thinking there was a good chance I would return it... nope, this was a perfect impulse buy lol. What more is there to say? It'll fill up the whole penthouse, it'll fill up the whole suite and so on.. perfect for getting lit! And with the extra 20% off offer, I paid like $60 total. It's a no brainer, BUY IT! Don't be dumb and buy one of those $200+ speakers just because of their brand name!PS: If you're a purist in terms of how you listen to your music, then I'm sure you'll find this speaker to not be hitting every little note you want. It's a durable, well made, loud party speaker that can take all the bass you throw at it. You can also mess around with the EQ to make it sound even better.. OR just buy another one so you can connect both of them - another reason why I gave up the extra 10W and bought this and not the 50W model. Honestly at this price, I'm most likely going to buy a 2nd one and always keep em together. $120 for a combined 80W, 4 woofers+4 tweeters is definitely the move üíØ Like I said, don't drop hundreds on a brand name speaker that won't be even half as loud as this.

Simple controls, simple interface. Even if the battery is half of what the promotional material says, it's going to be awesome.I have been an audiophile, built my own stereo equipment, and purchased plenty of retail speakers and amps over the years, including the some recent soundbars. The sound quality of this M83 is better any any other portable accessory I have used in the recent years, for a very reasonable price indeed. Solid build quality and the thing looks indestructible. We'll see. Right now I am more than pleased with it and would highly recommend it. If anything goes awry after this honeymoon period, I will update the review. Now back to the music from this little gem.UPDATE: The M83 has a software glitch that causes the device to lock up in a mode that prevents it from connecting, playing or ... turning it off. Very frustrating ... unless you know how to fix it, which is easy. There are several reviews here which reference this glitch, and quite a bit of chatter online about it too. But GOOD NEWS ... it is easy to fix and also easy to prevent.FIX IT: When the device locks up, blue light on or blinking all the time, no sound, won't connect and won't turn off: Insert a 3.5mm audio male plug (like the one for your celphone and for most audio devices with a headphone jack, or a speaker output jack) ..... just insert the plug into the audio plug on the M83. This will reset the software and cure the problem immediately. Insert the plug, the front indicator led will turn red for a few seconds, and then back to flashing blue ... now turn the M83 off, and back on, and the unit is reset. It's as easy as that. Keep this note because it is likely to happen to you and this procedure will fix it.As an aside, I am pretty sure I know why this is happening. The M83 has an odd, somewhat clever feature: It allows you to connect two M83's to the same host device .... When you do, the M83 software will split the two speaker sets into the two stereo channels which you can now physically separate (move the speakers away from each other) to get true stereo. And of course, more sound and more bass. Clever. The problem is that this bluetooth feature requires a software routine that has a bug in it. What happens is that if your M83 loses its connection while streaming, or if it is paired with, and talking to, more than one host (say, you have another device in the room that is paired with it, and is running with Bluetooth on) the clever software in the M83 gets caught in a loop and stuck ... locked up. That's when you get the Blue Light of Death ... it won't go out and you won't be able to turn the device off.)Now you know how to unlock it. But you can also prevent the glitch in most cases. One, always start your M83 session the same way. Start with the M83 turned off. Grab the host device and go into its Bluetooth dialog and remove the M83 from the paired list. Turn the Bluetooth off and back on. Re-add the M83, and wait until you have a CONNECT button. Now turn on the M83 and let it find the host. Hit the connect button on the M83 and let it pair and connect. Now you are good to go. When you are done listening to it, turn the M83 off, and then turn off the Bluetooth on the host. Also, while you are doing this, make sure that no other host devices are nearby which have paired with your M83 and might interfere with the pairing/connecting process.It sounds goofy, but if you follow this simple procedure you should have no problems. I cannot advise you about the two-M83 feature because I do not have two M83s and cannot test that. You will have to try that on your own if decide to go down that road.It would be really helpful if the manufacturer would put the reset procedure in the user manual, it is easy to do and works well but only if you know about it. I am going to try to downgrade my rating to 4 stars for this because this glitch is well known and the Bugani gods really need to take care of it. If they do, then we can put back the fifth star.

BUGANI,129.99,12,Black,2020-07-08,4,"Bugani M83 vs. Aomais Go, comparedI bought one each of the Bugani M83 and Aomais Go waterproof Bluetooth mobile speakers to compare. Both have the same wattage and similar good reviews, price point and (I assume) speaker size. Reviewers said they were pretty identical. I disagree - they have some differences.Played by itself, the Aomais Go sounded fine. I predicted I was going to keep the Aomais and return the Bugani. I might have liked it if I hadn‚Äôt compared the two side by side.Compared side by side, suddenly I liked the Bugani M83 better.Personally I like a lot of bass. And treble. My preferred equalizer pattern looks like a smile, with both ends turned up. The Bugani M83 was more like the equalization I like.But a lot of other people might like the Aomais better. Like, if you‚Äôre happy with speakers without changing the equalization or turning up the bass.The Bugani had more bass ‚Äî maybe too much bass, I thought at first. The Aomais by comparison had a bit less bass and I believe more mid. To me it was like a speaker with no equalization, or with the mid turned up a little.The speaker‚Äôs default equalization is important... Because some devices have no equalization feature. Or the equalization setting isn‚Äôt convenient to get to. And when connected to a device by Bluetooth (to Amazon Alexa, for example), the device‚Äôs equalization feature doesn‚Äôt work. So don‚Äôt count on equalization to be possible, unless you‚Äôre connected by AUX cord.The Bugani sounded a little clearer all around to me. Though if you don‚Äôt like a lot of bass, maybe it won‚Äôt sound clear to you.The Bugani has an extra slot on the side for inserting a micro SD card with music files. The rubber piece that you push in to keep the ports dry seemed heavier duty than the Aomais, though this means it is harder to push in and pull out.The Aomais plays a few cheesy sounding notes of music when it‚Äôs turned off and on. Not a big deal, but I like a simple beep better.There were some things I liked better about the Aomais. For example, the Bugani to me looks ugly ‚Äî again, like a brick. It‚Äôs rectangular and industrial. It‚Äôs also heavier and bigger (deeper/wider). The Aomais is noticeably thinner, and a bit lighter.The bottom of the Aomais has beveled edges on the front and back. You can lean the speaker back (to face upwards) or down, and it will probably stay, which is nice. (The Bugani is shaped like a brick, and is just as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to balance on one edge as a brick.)I like some things about the way the Aomais sounds. The Aomais has a similar sound / equalization no matter where you are in relation to it. The Bugani however sounds great mainly when you‚Äôre right in front of it. It seemed like the trebly highs fade out when you move even a little to the side.Also, I wanted a speaker that was directional, not 360 degree sound. The Aomais is more like that. The Bugani has a lot of loud bass sound coming out the back. I guess that‚Äôs its design.The Bugani has two large passive ‚Äúsubwoofer‚Äù panels on the back. If i understand, the panels aren‚Äôt powered speakers, but they float and vibrate with the sound waves to amplify the bass ‚Äî presumably out the back. That may be the reason for the Bugani‚Äôs louder bass.Having two panels on the back that you can press in feels a little weird to me - like they could be poked and damaged, though I guess that‚Äôs really not likely.The rubber covering the Aomais feels squishier ‚Äî like it would absorb the shock of a fall better. The Bugani had a somewhat harder material outside ‚Äî which feels solid, but also less absorbent of shocks.The Aomais has its controls easily accessible on the front ‚Äî unlike the Bugani which has its buttons on the side.The Aomais has 3 or 4 indicator lights to show different things. The Bugani had a light, but the light is off whether it‚Äôs off or on.",True

BUGANI,129.99,26,Black,2020-11-08,4,"Easily overlooked, Bugani's M83 deserves a look b4 you buy a W-King.After alot of research, more than I wanna admit trial/errors w suppose to be better,big name brand BT speakers from JBL, Sony, and even the value based, full size W-King.I use & prefer my Bugani M83 everyday now. Seriously for most occasions, inside and out it's my grab and go speaker.It's super loud if needed, yet remains clean & punchy as hell!It's weatherproof enough, IXP5/6. Its Bluetooth 5.0 equipped, features front loaded stereo neodymium drivers/AND horns.The big square bass radiators fire backwards on this M83, and go deep just like JBL's bass performance.it's actually pretty lightweight, and has a sturdy handle up top making it feel deceptively rugged and or sturdy.I forgot to mention it has a ridiculous amount of battery power/lifespan between charges.No, you won't realize how long 10,000 milliamps will go without dying until you forget the last time you had to charge it, amazingly long battery performance folks.admittedly I didn't catch mine on sale for $55, but it's honestly worth every bit of the usual $70 price point.If I had to say anything I don't like about this speaker, currently 2020, its missing the better micro USB type-C charging port I've come to prefer on everything I own these days.(Other than that, I do like to bump the upper treble portion of my phone's built-in EQ slightly up for hip-hop, kinda nice to customize your fav EQ curve on the M83.) I'm going to purchase a second M83 soon, two of these paired in TWS stereo is gonna be insane.My single M83 can already out perform my Charge 4, it's really better competition for the JBL Xtreme 2 tbh.Two paired M83's would gladly compete against the new Boombox 2.But they would be in stereo, and a fraction of the $500 Boombox 2.There is a new larger Bugani 50wt speaker out now with micro USB type-c charging, but it lacks tweeters.Overall it's decent, I think it's the M118.Check it out, it's 50wts, has a tiny bit more bass but lacks the sweet clarity of the M83.But if you are only impressed with a lot of bass and a much larger size speaker, Bugani's newest M118 maybe worth a look too.Forget the W-King btw, I've had two of them, they wouldn't pair, one sounded significantly better than the other which was odd too.Had to return both of them when I got my M83, they're built in DSP sounds cheaper, bass wasn't any better, plus at full volume there was audible distortion that you don't get with Bugani's products.Good luck folks, there's a lot of good Bluetooth speakers out there for very little money now.And thank God for Amazon's return policy, I'm done searching for my favorite for awhile.Cheers!",True

BUGANI,129.99,84,Black,2020-02-23,5,"Absolutely Phenomenal SpeakerIf you're in the market for a bluetooth speaker, you know how difficult it can be to decide on one, considering there are so many options.So I'm here to tell you to stop looking, because you're not going to find anything better than the Bugani bluetooth speaker.While I'm no audiophile, I know good sound when I hear it and the Bugani sounds fantastic out of the box. And if you're really into it, you can pair it up with an equalizer to customize the sound.The construction of the build quality is suburb as this bluetooth speaker can really take a lickin' and keep on tickin. It's definitely one of, if not the most sturdy of portable bluetooth speakers. Personally, I like to keep mine at home, but you can most certainly take this with you wherever you are, as the built in handle and lightweight construction makes it super portable.I am the owner of multiple bluetooth speakers - some very high end models like a JBL and Beats Beatbox and while those are great, they also cost upwards of $500 dollars once you factor in tax. The Bugani, on the other hand, is around $50 to $60 bucks and the sound quality is nearly identical. So why spend all that money when you can get something for a steal of a price with similar quality in sound?Perhaps one of my favorite things about the Bugani bluetooth speaker, is that you can pair them to create stereo surround sound. That's a great feature to have if you're having a party or simply want to have that stereo feel.Another great feature with this speaker is that it's all natural - and what I mean by that - is that there's no built in chamber to muffle the noise. A lot of speakers will only allow you to get so loud and then it starts reducing the sound. Not with this speaker. You can turn it up as loud as you want. Granted, you do need to be careful as to not blow out the speakers by going overboard, but I hate how some speakers decide to tell you how loud you are going to play your music. This one, does not, and it's great.Overall, you simply can't go wrong with the Bugani. It's an absolutely phenomenal speaker in regards to the price point and unless you're going to spend $500 dollars, you're really not going to find anything remotely close to the sound it can produce. Add in all the great features like the great sound, fully responsive buttons (that make a very small clicking noise so you know you touched them), portability, etc, and you can see why this is the best bluetooth speaker on the market for it's price point.",True

BUGANI,129.99,7,Black,2019-11-10,4,"Best bluetooth speaker I've ever owned, at a great price..Update January 5th, 2020:Originally bought this back in early November, charged it once when I got it.. it's still at 70% charge according to my phone when connected via bluetooth. I use it every day as well when showering, and brought it to a few gatherings. So it certainly last a long while, and still sounds excellent..----Original review:----I knew when I got this speaker that the sound would be pretty good, but I was blown away with just how good it is. The base AND treble are amazing, but man.. that bass is really quite something. I listened to Billie Eilish's ""Bad Guy"" song because it has a deep bass in the background, and it sounded absolutely perfect. Even maxing out the volume seems to maintain clarity with every song I've tried thus far.The design looks pretty sleek, but also like you could drop it and it would be perfectly fine, because it also has a ruggedness to it. The design helps keep it splash proof, but its hardly ""waterproof"" because its only IPX5.. so the max it could handle is maybe a light to medium rainfall. Definitely don't expect this to survive submersion, so keep a safe distance from the pool. I do enjoy the all black style with the brushed aluminum ""grill"" on the speakers. It's probably made of plastic, but it sure looks nice. The buttons are nice and big so there's really no missing them, and the handle seems especially sturdy.When they say its 40W I assume they mean its 20W per speaker, but many bluetooth speakers around the same price have a much lower wattage, so this thing was a steal.All in all, it's a pretty great device. The first charge took quite some time for me, (3 and a half hours). I'm not sure how charged up it was out of the box, so it could take even longer from an empty battery, maybe 4-5 hours. Supposedly it lasts for quite a while though.My only nitpick was that it didn't come with a wall charger. Well, it's supposed to come with a usb to micro-usb cable, but mine didn't even arrive with that, just an AUX cord, which is why I docked one star. But it wasn't enough for me to be angry, because we all have micro-usb to usb cables lying around as we all own a cell phone.In time, I will return to update my review on the speakers' longevity and other info, once I've had more time with it.",True

BUGANI,129.99,1,Black,2021-07-31,5,"Don't spend a lot of money on the ""big names""This is my 3rd Bugani M83 that I've purchased. I liked my 1st one (purchased in May of 2019) so much that I took it to work (I work in a warehouse where we can all have our own music, so I needed something that could get loud if I wanted.) I had to buy #2 (in Nov of 2019) for my original intent, which was outdoor/beach/pool activities.This thing has gone everywhere with me. I even put it in the back seat of my husband's car for short trips. Since he doesn't have as kickin' a stereo as I have in my car. It drove 700+ miles with us to a beach house for a family wedding, and blew everyone else's bluetooth speakers away! I got so many questions about it!Unfortunately, my first one that I took to work with me refused to charge anymore. I realized the charging port was messed up and coming loose inside. It was no doubt from me constantly plugging it in and unplugging it to take it between warehouses with me (and others ""borrowing it and yanking out the plug/walking away with it before it was unplugged, etc.) 100% my fault and my co-workers fault. I could have contacted the Bugani company for assistance, but I'm impatient and couldn't wait for a new one! I still have my 'broken' one, so maybe I will and I'll have an extra one!So that brings me to #3 which I just purchased a few days ago. #2 replaced the original #1 at work, and now #3 has a happy new home here and more adventures ahead at the pool/beach/road trips, etc.Did I mention the sound and bass are unparalleled in any other portable bluetooth speaker I've seen/heard? No? Well they are. As evidenced by me purchasing THREE of them in the last few years. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that asks. No one should spend a fortune on a bluetooth speaker when this gem is out there for a fraction of the price, and ridiculously good sounding. The battery also seems to last for ages!",True

Don't be fooled by the lower price tag or that you never heard of the brand......its quality speaks for itself and provides really good sound. It gets VERY loud even on half setting and the fact that it can go even louder and still not distort is nothing short of amazing. To get the most out of it pair it with an EQ app and prepare to be blown away......I ended up buying a second one to see it at full power with the TWS function and man.......WHAT a sound (full range stereo)......So if your on the look for a good bluetooth speaker and want it to sound loud and have good low end.....then look no further.

BUGANI,129.99,4,Black,2023-05-16,5,"VERY SOLID BLUTOOTH SPEAKERI wasn't crazy about this Bugani ""60 watt"" speaker at first because my ""30 watt"" soundscore motion boom speaker out of the box sounded just as loud and actually better. So that is a very good speaker for the money. However, after using this speaker for over 2 months now I like it more. The Soundcore has Digital signal processing (DSP). I don't believe that this speaker has DSP. So out of the box the Soundcore sounds better and just as loud as the SHOCKW. However, the Soundcore is also being pushed to the limit with that DSP. In fact I damaged/stretched the speaker when a really heavy bass song played and the speaker started clipping bad. So the Soundcore is being driven to the max, This SHOCKW is not being driven hard at all. Everybody likes a loud speaker, but nobody likes a blown speaker. If you want to play it safe just play the speaker as is. Me? I downloaded an EQ for it. I've tuned the speaker to make it sound better to me. Also, I'm driving it harder. Making it louder. Basically, you can do with an EQ what the DSP does. Don't push it too hard though. Anyway, this is a very nice and loud speaker and a good value for money. It out performs many other more expensive speakers.",True

Excellent battery life.Knocked off one star becasue my first two M83's came with metal speaker grills. A feature which made this product feel like top shelf.This new unit came with plastic speaker grills. A little disappointing.This the second time i buy a Bugani product that at first, is shipped with great components, but as time goes on and they sell more units, they start to skimp on components. I purchased a M118 in 2021. The sound was impressive. I then purchased another M118 earlier this year (2023) and the production had changed. It weighed less and the sound was not as good as my first unit. I returned the second M118.All in all, an excellent value for the price. Sounds better than my M118.",True

BUGANI,129.99,0,Black,2020-12-16,5,"Very impressedThis brand is completely unknown to me so I took a chance buying this, based on the reviews. I am glad I listened. The speaker is robust, very durable (I use it while mining/prospecting), and has good sound quality.I like the quality of the unit itself. It is built quite well, feels like a higher end product. The handle is very useful, and the exterior is tough. Albeit, I would have prefered a more solid plastic just because I use it in the mountains and it attracts dust more than solid plastic.The sound quality is why I went with this unit. It has 2 pairs of speakers on each side, with a woofer AND a tweeter, which most affordable bluetooth speakers do not have (they usually are full range speakers). The tweeter just adds the crispness to the sound, making the rock and metal I listen to much more enjoyable. The vocals, drums, guitars, etc are all well separated and sound good!It gets loud too, really loud!!! I am guessing, but I think I usually have it at 1/4th volume and its still at a decent level. The sound doesn't distort to higher levels, albeit I have not pushed it to the max. I don't think I ever will... I just can't wait to take it on my camping trips next year!!Overall, great unit. Its a little bigger than my previous portable speakers, but its so, so much better sounding its worth lugging it around. And its battery is so huge it lasts an entire day of digging, AND still has juice to keep my iPhone running! Which reminds me, it connects with my phone fast and easily.Only con I can think of is that its bigger and heavier, so when I am lugging 40-50 pounds of tools and this, I can tell the difference. But, again, the sound is good enough to warrant the extra weight!",True

BUGANI,129.99,216,Black,2019-10-18,5,They're OK a Bit Muffled Though üëåThe media could not be loaded. The sound quality is good depends on what you're listening to and with the use of an EQ. It is not better than a JBL Extreme 2 as some people have indicated but for the money these are fairly good. I bought these bc of the raving reviews and everyone saying it has bass. Let's talk about the bass...The bass is a low end cheap dirty bass like all the treble has been turned down and the mids are geared towards the low end. It sounds a little muffled. It is not a clean booming bass. It does hit the low tones giving a full body thumpy sound but it's not a booming bass. It can be a little thumpy and boomy with an EQ and angled a certain way depending on what you're listening to but it's not consistent with everything you listen to. An EQ helps greatly here. The speaker sounds so much better and less muffled.The highs are weak It is not bright it is not sharp again use an EQ it helps a lot and improves the sound giving it more clarity and provides a cleaner sound. That is why I don't give it less stars because the capability is there.The build quality is good. It feels nice with soft touch rubber even on the handle. Button press is good everything connects fast and easy. TWS is a breeze too. There is a tiny bit of latency watching videos but it is certainly not bad and that's in TWS. There's hardly any out of sync issues with just 1 speaker. Battery life is good battery charge is slightly below average taking a bit longer but its not bad it lasts a long time. I'm giving this 5 stars bc of the price. It was about $55. Had it been priced higher for the sound quality you get I would have given it less stars.If I heard these in person I probably would not have purchased them. BUT the price makes these appealing for what you get so I'm keeping them. FYI the W-King D8 costs a little more but sounds much better but they don't have a convenient grab handle. These aren't bad and using an EQ definitely improves the overall sound quality. Look for my review and comparisons on YouTube. üòâ,True

They said they'd replace the original without cost...I asked for the newer usd-c version...didn't get that but they did send me a new speaker of the same model and I didn't have to return the original...which I had threw out anyway.Given the cust. service I'm normally used to theses day I am thoroughly impressed.OLD REVIEW***I've had this for 2 years, sturdy, sounds good, well built...except for the charging port. Used it in my workout room for music and in the yard for BBQ's so didn't move it around that much, didnt unplug it that much. About 6 months ago I started having issues with the charging port...I'd plug it in and it felt wobbly, sometimes it would be plugged in but not charging, I had to screw around with it progressively more as time went on to get the little red charging light to come on...yesterday it stopped charging altogether no matter what I did....the rest of the speaker is in excellent condition and I have no doubt it would last another ten years...but its useless because I can't power it.",True
BUGANI,129.99,6,Black,2022-09-26,5,"Great choice for the price, couple of flawsI've used this speaker daily for a year and a half, and overall I recommend it.* It sounds great, it can get quite loud, and I never feel I'm missing sound quality. Greatly surpasses many other Bluetooth speakers.* It's easy to prop up on its side, it's outdoor friendly, and it's easy to carry around.* Connectivity usually works fine, BUT there's a quirk. If you turn Bluetooth off on your phone, go out of range, or turn your phone off while connected, the speaker will lock up. Once locked up, it won't connect or disconnect to any device; it won't turn off or respond to any commands. When this happens, you must stick a needle or pin into the small hole where a reset button lurks. There is nothing about this in any manual, but many others have had the same problem. The easiest solution is just to get into the habit of turning the speaker off before disconnecting. This can be a pain when traveling and a needle isn't handy.* Connection range is also pretty good.* Battery life is pretty good. I can listen for 30 minutes a day for weeks before it goes low. However, the low battery noise is extremely annoying and becomes more frequent as it progresses. It quickly evolves from a simple notification to an outright annoyance.Overall, I've enjoyed this speaker and bought another one for my dad.",True

Marshall Emberton II,119.99,168,Black,2022-10-01,5,"Great product with usage caveatsA few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.",True

Marshall Emberton II,119.99,22,Black,2023-03-29,5,"Love, love, love, and love...So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.",True
Marshall Emberton II,119.99,12,Black,2024-02-28,4,"Three + 1/2 stars.Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design.

Marshall Emberton II,119.99,4,Black,2024-06-05,4,"Rich sound - with the right musicWhat I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).",True

Marshall Emberton II,119.99,3,Black,2024-01-10,5,"So Cool...I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.",True
Marshall Emberton II,119.99,1,Black,2024-07-07,5,"Wow !What do I like about this Marshall Bluetooth Speaker? EVERYTHINGCompact size does not mean this speaker has compact sound. This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music. Look at others if you wish, or save time and get this little powerhouse, Marshall.",True

Marshall Emberton II,119.99,3,Black,2024-02-20,5,"A simple, solid speakerIf you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.",True

Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL.I love the look of this little Marshall, classic! But, I probably should have listened to my daughter.The sound is decent to good. There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters ‚Äì B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker ‚Äì and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did!

Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 7,139.95,26,Black,2022-08-11,5,"Way better than JBL or othersReally glad I went with this option instead of spending about the same on a JBL or other popular brand. The sound quality difference is impressive, because of it's dedicated speakers. It sounds about the same or better than the $400+ Bose Portable Smart Speaker or Sonos Move. I tried them out to compare and it's the best in my opinion. Can't even compare this to JBL or the numerous other bluetooth speakers, even their high end models, this thing is way better.At the price point this is at right now, it is less than half the cost of what it's worth. It can be a bit confusing, with there being an Onyx 6, Onyx 4, etc - I just went with the Onyx 7 after researching a bit and I am glad I did. The Onyx 6 is very similar, just a very slight different sound. I think you'd be good with either and can choose more on looks in my opinon.The battery life advertises at 8hr, but surprisingly it has been 10 hours now and it was still working before I turned it off. We had it at about half volume (which is plenty loud) which might be why. It has a dedicated charger which is maybe a negative, but not a big deal.Great build quality, hefty without being too much to carry around.The packaging and charger quality is pretty impressive, they put some thought and effort into this.Have to give it to Harman Kardon, you aren't just buying a gimmicky name or something with this thing. Sure, it isn't audiophile grade $1000+ speakers, but it's the best speaker in this form factor in my opinion.",True

If this is confirmed, it will be more complicated to use an external battery, and if they do not improve the internal battery, this could mean a setback, so the Onyx Studio 7 model can be a great advantage, since normally the sound power does not change between generations very quickly.",True

Long short of it I now have 2 speakers. The pairing was tricky, but for a 1 minute pairing, do this as no one addresses that on reviews . PAIRING INSTRUCTIONS1. Get your pairing device ready: Once you have the two speakers close to you, you can then turn on one of the speakers. On your mobile device, navigate to Bluetooth and turn it on, then pair the phone with one of the Harman Kardon Onyx speakers that you have turned on. Once it is successfully paired with the speaker, you can then turn on the other speaker.2. Use the connect + feature: All you need to do is to simultaneously press and hold the Connect + buttons or Bluetooth buttons on the 2 speakers for at least 7 seconds. The LED light on the two speakers should blink white very quickly if the speakers have been paired successfully.3. The Bluetooth buttons pressed simultaneously does the magic in a second and they are paired !!!!4. Enjoy great sound: Once you have successfully paired the 2 Harman Kardon Onyx speakers, you can then begin to enjoy quality sound production.You all are welcome and Harman Kardon Rocks !",True

Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore,145.35,7,Blue,2024-03-03,4,"A Posh Music speaker!B&O makes posh high end audio gear‚Ä¶.gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard ‚ÄúType II anodization‚Äù on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it‚Äôs hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it‚Äôs water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don‚Äôt expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there‚Äôs just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn‚Äôt reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn‚Äôt reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it‚Äôs a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn‚Äôt necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don‚Äôt want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it‚Äôs still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don‚Äôt mind paying more for something that feels like it‚Äôs going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5",True

I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I‚Äôm camping. It‚Äôs a small space so I don‚Äôt need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I‚Äôm thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it‚Äôs just a wireless speaker. It‚Äôs not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it‚Äôs a good value. I guess I‚Äôm comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. ü§© I can crank it to infinity and it‚Äôs crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O?

Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore,145.35,66,Black,2021-07-13,5,"I really like it!I‚Äôve seen too many bad reviews on this one so I wanted to give my opinion. First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn‚Äôt really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",True

The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsmart speak‚Äô.

However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It‚Äôs a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn‚Äôt change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me.

I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I‚Äôm so glad I gave this a shot. It‚Äôs perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it‚Äôs coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it‚Äôs super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I‚Äôm not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it‚Äôs not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little ‚Äútinny‚Äù once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you‚Äôll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play.

The bass is not even comparable, and the clarity of the treble is also so severely lacking to something at the same price point. What a disgrace. Only consolation is the sleek design.

Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore,145.35,3,,2024-05-10,2,"Beautiful GownsLike Aretha said about Taylor, gorgeous gowns. This speaker is so lovely to look at, sturdy and smooth in sound. But lack of basic functions make it a waste of money, especially as it wastes so much time. It usually powers on at full volume, no matter how volume is adjusted on the device it‚Äôs connected to.And adjusting volume from your device is randomly not an option. also you need to download an app to use it at all. If more than one device has it saved, you don‚Äôt get to decide which device the speaker will connect to. Mid-play, the speaker will switch to the other device, then in order to switch back, you‚Äôd have to forget the speaker on one device or turn off Bluetooth. It takes a very particular situation for uninterrupted and dramatic comedy-free playback.

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose‚Äôs sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos‚Äô Roam is a close runner-up, but it‚Äôs sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore,145.35,12,Green,2023-10-25,1,"Don‚Äôt waste money in B&O crappy productsI recently purchased a Bang & Olufsen speaker, attracted by its sleek design and premium external materials. Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand.

Sony SRS-XG300 X-Series,194.95,3,Black,2023-11-10,4,"Still deciding if I love itI'm not crazy about the fact that you cannot disable the microphone because it prevents me from dictating on my phone if I have it connected, and I also think it tends to be a little bass heavy without adjusting the equalizer in the app, and the app is kind of outdated in my opinion. That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price. I also love that it has USB-C charging, as well an extra USB port to charge my phone.",True
Sony SRS-XG300 X-Series,194.95,0,Black,2024-08-29,2,"Worse sound than expectedWe have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc‚Ä¶and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it‚Äôs older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there‚Äôs virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of ‚Äútinny‚Äù during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn‚Äôt sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that‚Äôs half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that‚Äôs about the most I would ever pay for it‚Ä¶but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you‚Äôll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase.

Sony SRS-XG300 X-Series,194.95,9,Gray,2023-11-17,5,Great Buy for outdoor needsI switched to this speaker after using the waterproof JBL speaker. Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn‚Äôt specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product.

Well, we had this speaker at a at rendezvous of a motley lot of characters deep within the twigs of the Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin where it was playing at minimum 12-hours straight with plenty to go and only plugged in on a recharge simply because we were not using it. I haven't tested out the guitar plug-in, as of yet. So I cannot report on that aspect. But the lights are cool especially during nightfall if you're into that sort of thing.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse.

Sonos Roam 2,179.0,7,Black,2024-07-27,5,"Big sound in a portable packageEasy setup like other Sonos experience. Very pleased that the sound is so full for a small speaker. Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.",True

Sonos Roam 2,179.0,16,White,2024-07-08,4,"Underwhelming performanceSo, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you‚Äôve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it‚Äôs okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don‚Äôt try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you‚Äôre pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I‚Äôm missing the mark on its intended use, but I don‚Äôt think so. For small sound and high portability, it‚Äôs okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I‚Äôll have to sample it for a while and along others. I‚Äôm on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I‚Äôll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it‚Äôs pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it‚Äôs been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it‚Äôs worth it.",True

We currently have several ""Play One"", Move and Sound bar components throughout the house. The Roam used in a quiet room is just ""barely"" OK, but not up to usable SONOS quality sound..

My past Speakers(Sonos Beam and Sonos One) often would just randomly not be recognized and setting them up again was a horrible pain. I purchased this Roam 2 because I had been using a Sonos One outside for the last couple of years and it died (I figured that it might eventually since it wasn't designed for outdoors even though it was covered).I'm thankfully that the new Roam 2 is waterproof and I like it's streamlined design and the sound it good. Setup was relatively easy although I really disliked that they just sent a cheap usb C connector instead of an actual plug. The connector sent was a usb c to usb c so I had to search for a spare ""brick"" and a spare usb c cable which I fortunately had but still...I thought that was a poor way to start.I never could get Alexa to work which was frustrating but I noticed that Sonos now has it's own voice assistant and that works well.I'm overall satisfied with the speaker and hoping it stays consistent and performs well.

Sonos Roam 2,179.0,0,Black,2024-07-30,4,"Nice speaker, decent soundOverall, this speaker is good. I can see other speakers being better for the same price point, but here's a breakdown of what I have found after using it consistently for the past week or so:Connectivity - In the sense of range to connect, it is quite low. I have had multiple instances where I was using the speaker with bluetooth and it would start cutting out when I was 10+ feet away. On the other hand, you can also connect to this speaker through wifi which gives it great connectivity range.Ease of use - It is a pretty simple device with only 6 buttons (Play/Pause, volume up, volume down, voice activation, bluetooth, and power). No complaints here though I cannot speak for the voice feature as I have not used it yet.Sound quality - The sound quality is great for its size. If you are an audiophile, you have probably heard better speakers but for this size it is definitely above the standard.Battery Life - The battery life it pretty spotty and has been hard for me to understand. Sonos says it has 10 hour battery life off of full charge but I would probably say it is closer to 8.5-9 hrs from my use of it.Additional notes - The app is pretty annoying to use and can only be used when your device is connected to wifi. On the app you can control your music/audio you are playing and also balance the speakers treble and bass (something I have not been able to do off of wifi)",True

It has great tonality and an expansive sound stage, one which is tailored to your listening area. I have tried a lot of mobile blue tooth speakers, and this is one of the best in terms of audio quality, which is, absolutely, one of the most impot5rant factors, really the most important. I would compare it only to the Klipsch, B & O, Devialet.So why did I rate it 4 stars?1. I find it insulting or worse when a piece of equipment in this price range is so intrusive, puts so much effort into violating your privacy. Install the app and you will have none. I fully intend to uninstall rhe app. I may even do a full reset on my phone, but having installed it and created an accoujnt I asm already on a list they wil undoubtedly be selling.You can set up blue tooth without the app, but not wifi. Having connected to blue tooth I had to reset the speaker to install the app. It took me hou4rs, much like the B & O, which I was unhappy with for exactly the same reasons.*IF* you use th3 app you can not use a music player. I personally hate listening to music on my phone. In fact, I needed to make a call but couldn't because I was using the speaker, and it completely drained the battery on my phone. (Wifi and blue tooth will do that) make a call and could not because I was using the speaker. It also completely drained my phone's battery.2. Using a player would not have given me the benefits I get on many other blue tooth speakers because the Roam does not process lossless blue tooth codecs. You lose detail in transmission. Not everyone cares about this but most audiophile listeners do, so for a company of this quality, producing equipment in this price range, it is surprising and disappointing.No aptx, aptx hd or ldac.It does do some tricks if you have other Sonos speakers, like casting to the speaker in the next room.3. IPX rating questionable. The port is open, uncovered. I would not take this speaker to the beach, or even out ion the rain.With or without the app? The app does get you spatial tuning, BUT, besides issues already mentioned I lost the DAC on my FIIO, in addition to lossless blue tooth.In sum, the sound is very good but I feel that you pay a high price for it in terms of intrusiveness.I do not feel as though I would be sacrificing a great deal if I listened to my Klipsch instead, on my FIIO, weith location... turned off on my phone.

The sound is really good considering the size. And for me, bass is everything as I play bass and love to hear the bass lines clearly.

The Alexa integration is also very good - you can power up the speaker and ask Alexa to play anything through connected services like Spotify or other music libraries and it does what you expect it to do - play music! The real let down is in in the recent overhaul of the Sonos app. Unfortunately, Sonos took a very good functioning S2 app and ruined it when they relaunched the app to handle the new Sonos Ace headphones. They've been working on re-adding features for the last two months and it's starting to improve, but very slowly. So buyer beware - you may want to wait until they get the app back to a more solid state before you jump into a Roam.

This is easy competition for Beats pill or the Bose versions in this size group and better in many ways. One of the ways is the tech. Also known as the bad reviews, at least for now. They need to update some areas with the software and the app. This needs to work perfect for what it cost (I hope you hear me Sonos!). If they fix the connectivity and wifi issues this is a winner. If you want a great piece of hardware with stand alone function it's a winner. For owners of other Sonos products having issues, they owe you an apology and a quick solution.

It is also a lot more simple to use than most others, the bluetooth pairing button on the back makes pairing to a new device sooooo much easier. You don‚Äôt need to guess at what combo of buttons you need to hold to put it into pairing mode. One other thing I like that others may not like is that if you do not play any sound for a few minutes it will auto shut off. I personally like this because it saves battery at times where I know I would have forgotten to turn it off myself. USB C charging is a nice touch also now that most things are using this charger is almost the only cable I have now. I have not tested the mic yet but I have jumped into the pool with it once so I can say its waterproof at least for the 4 foot pool I jumped into.

Pairing over Bluetooth is simple, as with like any other Bluetooth speaker or other device. Pairing is the same. But like the other Sonos speakers this is also made specifically to work with the Sonos App in which you can connect multiple speakers throughout a home. That works well but I struggle to see why that'd be important on a portable speaker. I suppose it is nice to have the option. The sound is very good. It can get loud enough for a whole room. The trembles and mids are nice and clear. The bass is loud too (but I did notice some mudding at higher volume which is honestly to be expected with a portable speaker like this.)

I had and issue at first hooking Apple Music into it but a reboot of my phone and the speaker fixed that. Its small size makes it versatile and it surely feels like a quality product.

There's no question about that. But you do get what you pay for and this is a portable camping type speaker. The only thing I would advise is they do make rubber protective boots for t well they're not exactly designed for this model is the previous model a little bit of work with an X-Acto knife and you can cut out the necessary cut out so that you can hit the button in the back, but that makes a difference as far as impact resistance so worth picking one of those up.

It doesn't have a super rich bass, compared to my other Sonos speakers, but it's still decent. I use the overture from Tron: Legacy as a test track, so I have a reference I can compare on each speaker I listen on, and it does miss some of the really rich deep notes when the music swells at around 1:35.All that said, this isn't a one-speaker-replacement for an amazing sound system. It's a portable speaker that sounds pretty great, which is suitable for taking outdoors and can sync with your existing Sonos system, and it excels at that.

This speaker sounds good, not quite as nice as the Sonos 1 but when they are paired together I can't really tell the difference. I'm not an aficionado by any means but when I had these two playing together, it made me go ""Oh, I should get another Sonos 1, that'd sound real nice"". Initial set up with Bluetooth was simple, but getting it to pair with my Sonos 1 took a couple minutes, a WTF, and a phone restart to get everything synced up. I wish charging status light would stay on while charging, mine doesn't even with the status light enabled in app. Also wish battery % wasn't buried so far down the app, it should be right there on the main screen in the app. Is this the best speaker at this size and price, I don't know but probably not..

For something like Beyonce's Cowboy Carter, it revealed the lower nuances in her voice and a pleasantly booming bass. Overall, I found that the sound was fuller and richer at higher volumes, something I did not expect. It is absolutely stunning in a large room out by the pool. At lower volumes in my office, it feels slightly underpowered. At high volumes in my office...well, I don't get much done. I love this little thing!

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,49,Black,2021-03-14,5,"This Little Speaker is Seriously ImpressivePros:- Sound quality is the best in it's class. This speaker has lots of depth and is rich, immersive and crystal clear. I find that when I listen to this speaker about a foot or two away on my desk, it sounds so, so rich - especially with low-fi songs. The 360-sound effect creates a very immersive stereo effect. You learn to appreciate and notice it with more usage. Overall, I enjoy how this speaker sounds with most genres - especially genres with clear instrumentals and vocals. This is clearly not a giant bass monster due to its size, but the depth and richness in the bass is surprising, especially when set up about a foot away from a wall. Overall, I would give the sound quality a 10/10 compared to the many other speakers I have tested in the past (Sony, JBL, etc..). This may not be the loudest speaker for the price, but it is definitely the most hi-fi when compared to the other mono-sounding options. Personally, I find that it gets VERY loud for casual listening. Nonetheless, the sound that comes out of this little speaker is trippy. it gives off the impression (mainly when it's close to you) that you're listening to a large, rich speaker. It's also worth mentioning that the quality is retained even in lower volumes.- Design. Easily the most beautiful bluetooth speaker I've had. Made from nothing but premium materials and it looks beautiful. Not much else to say here. It's also really tiny which makes it more adorable and portable. Perfect for picnics.- Battery life. As I mentioned earlier, this thing gets plenty loud. I usually play music at around 30% on this speaker and find that it is plenty loud for casual listening. Most people may opt for 50% while around the house. Regardless, the battery life is insanely good. This efficiency in battery life has to do with the type of amplifier this speaker is.Cons:- Hmm... I can't really think of any. I feel that it is priced fairly. While you can buy slightly bigger, more powerful speakers, they will simply lack the depth and richness in sound coming from this little thing. This is more of a high-quality listening experience compared to the ""boominess"" of larger speakers that feel like the sound is being muddled through some sort of barrier. Point is, anything below the retail price is a steal for this awesome speaker.Overall, this is such an awesome and special little speaker. It's hard to compare because it's very distinct in it's own unique way when you factor in the crazy 360 audio + amazing clarity and richness in bass. They really nailed this one.",True
Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,22,Black,2023-07-14,5,"Marshall vs. Bose Soundlink Flex vs. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore : This Wins hands down.Purchased all the three of the above portable bluetooth speakers as the JBL flip I have had for years had only one volume (Loud) and sounded more and more as it was coming through a tin can. When I lived alone I could crank music on my stereo through high end gear in most of the house, but now I have to be more considerate of my roommate. I suspected none of the offerings in the class of speaker were going to be great, but wanted something that at least didn't make my fingernails itch. As I get tired of wearing ear buds/head phones, decided this was the perfect opportunity to try an upgrade. Thanks to all the purchasers who did reviews, it helps to limit the field and I do rely heavily on customer feedback in making a buying decision.So in last place without even listening to anything else was the Bose Soundlink Flex. It only sounded marginally better than the old one I have which is terrible. If that was as good as it gets I would have just stuck with constantly wearing earbuds.In the middle was the Ban & Olufsen Beosound Expore. The sound was much fuller and less muddy. While it wasn't great it was tolerable. A bonus was that you got sound all around so would be perfect when you are working and moving in the room. While significantly heavier and bulkier than the Bose, it was in the middle size wise as the Marshall was without question the largest of the three. The app was nice as well although I don't like using those to control my speakers particularly when working because my hands are usually busy and messy and don't want to be handling the phone constantly. It had a small strap for carrying but it was definitely going to need to be clipped on to something very securely if you are moving around with it.The Marshall won by a mile. The sound was far more full, less muddy and with sound coming out both forwards and rear continued to give an all around sound as opposed to one direction of sound. Perhaps size is a function of sound quality because without question it is the largest. it is also the best looking. As I plan to use this around my house, it is perfectly fine in size and if the sound hadn't been tolerable I was going to go evetn bigger with a plugged in blue tooth speaker even though that would have been a pain in the butt.Am I getting the quality of sound I would prefer? No of course not and I wasn't expecting to as size is a clear element in recreation of sound. I don't know if this will be as sturdy as the other two. Both of them seemed encased in .more shock absorbing materials.This was also the most expensive but not significantly more. Given the vast improvement in sound quality I was more than willing to pay a bit more and the Prime Day sale price definitely helped.I will update with use. I would have posted a video but based on my own listening to reviews, I realize that they are truly not helpful because what you are listening on will be big part of the sound you are hearing.",True
Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,2,Black,2024-07-23,5,"Impressive acoustic output in a small packageThe Marshall Stockwell II certainly lives up to the Marshall reputation. My audio experience and extensive audio knowledge in speaker system and crossover network design spans almost 5 decades. The Marshall Stockwell II most certainly takes advantage of soft and hard surface geometry for tailoring to individual psychoacoustic tastes and preferences. The bass and treble controls offer outstanding range of boost and cut in broad frequency spectrums. This is absolutely the BEST portable for its size on the market. Clear, clean audio at all reproduction levels and can be pushed into slight fuzz at extremes. I will be buying more Marshall portables in the near future.",True
Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,7,Black,2023-09-09,4,"Loud enoughGreat unit. Was a bit worried that it wasn't loud enough when I first got it, then I remembered that you can control the volume not only with the knobs on this unit but also with your phone; once I jacked up the volume control on my phone, it was louder than I'll probably ever need it to be. The sound is noticeably richer/fuller than a cheaper, smaller portable Marshall speaker I tried, so it was an easy decision to keep this one and return the other. The other reason I prefer this unit is this one has treble and bass controls. I'm not sure how I feel about the strap, so I'm glad it can be tucked behind the unit out of sight, and I'm glad it's detachable. It looks like an adorable little baby amp without the strap. The unit was very easy to pair with my phone and didn't require installing a new app. It came with a charging cord but not the chunky little cube that the cord plugs into to plug into an electrical outlet, which was a little disappointing, but I had another one that I use for another purpose that I was able to use, so I guess we're saving the environment by not having a dedicated chunky cube for this unit, which admittedly I don't anticipate needing to charge very often. All in all I'm very happy with this speaker; I'm deducting one star only because it would be nice if it could go louder, given the price. It's just barely loud enough but it would be nice if it could knock my socks off and be something I could be confident would be loud enough for a house party.",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,13,Black,2021-01-05,5,"Front & Back ""360"" driver design is King üëëI tend to scour the internet for hours of reviews and YouTube videos and any information I can when it comes to audio/video/PC part purchases.It was between this, the older Denon Envaya and Anker Soundcore Motion+.(price point between 100 - 200.) I snagged the Stockwell II on WHD for 140 and it is undoubtedly the best BT speaker in my small collection.Moving up from mainly a Divoom Outdoor2 it's such a difference. The sound is FULL and the onboard EQ edjustments are a real luxury. Bass is balanced, not boomy! Not muddy! Very clean.For those who don't know the Outdoor2 and Stockwell II both have drivers on both the front and back of the speakers. The soundstage and stereo separation effects this does has now become a must-have for me. I don't think I can't use a BT speaker that doesn't produce ""360"" sound in this way.The Stockwell 2 is the best off-axis, walk around the house, portable speaker I can think of. It sounds great from so many angles instead of just front and center. I love this thing. The black and brass version is super sleek.Main cons: It's not super duper loud. If you're taking this outside with other noises you'd be better off with a larger boombox style speaker. This probably won't cut it for you. Volume settings 1-5 *are* pretty low vs. other boomier, muddier, mono sounding BT speakers.6-8 are mostly where I stay9-10 imo are plenty loud and would definitely disturb my upstairs neighbor.In conclusion, the Stockwell 2 is all about sound quality. And it provides that whether you're at 10% or 100% volume - across all genres. Extreme metal, synthwave, R&B, you name it, it's got you covered. Drop any bias towards the Marshall brand name - this speaker lives up to any hype and is worth every penny.",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,2,Black,2023-10-28,1,"Bad - previous Marshall Customer (long review)This is gonna be a long detailed review for those of you that really like a lot of detail!1. I am a previous customer of a Marshall, portable speaker - Kilburn 1 - I‚Äôve had this for a few years and I have yet to ever have a problem with Bluetooth pairing. I only use it when I want to feel surroundsound on my flatscreen TV or I want to plug it to my Crosley record player - so other than that it just sits and waits for me to use it and it is still working till this day!That one cost me a pretty penny as well I think into the $299 range but the reason I was looking for some thing smaller with the handle was the Kilburn original is super heavy.I wanted a smaller Marshall speaker because they look beautiful, I wanted a handle for the portability of moving it between my bathroom my kitchen in my office space when I‚Äôm listening to music and podcasts.2. Let‚Äôs talk about the review of the actual product. Spoiler Alert: there isn‚Äôt much to say because I could not pair it. I even let it re-charge overnight just in case even though it said it was fully charged at arrival.I tried pairing it with two different iPhones. I don‚Äôt need to try anymore than this.! I have owned multiple JBL, portable speakers, and other cheaper brands and pairing has never been a problem!So for any product to take this long to try to pair means that Marshall really made a horrible product or a really big, horrible batch considering the other negative reviews on the Bluetooth pairing, and the item going out after six months or even a year!* the other thing I noticed the very last time I tried to pair it was the moment I turned the volume knob to turn on the device. I heard a split second of a static sound, and I knew that wasn‚Äôt good.!This item arrived as a refurbished item so I had gotten it for $145. I was super excited because I buy a lot of Amazon refurbished products including very expensive Apple products, and I can‚Äôt tell you how wonderful of an experience I‚Äôve had buying refurbished or used or open box where some products would arrive mostly completely blemish free! And they would last a long time!So I will be returning this and considering this defective when I return it. If it doesn‚Äôt work out of the box, it‚Äôs not going to work and it‚Äôs not a good product and that‚Äôs my very strong opinion when it comes to any electronics that you purchase.Marshall, if you‚Äôre reading this, considering your other reviews, you made a really bad product you need to reconsider your manufacturer and may be any possible shortcutsI really specifically wanted this for the size of how small it was and the awesome handle that came with it so if you can remake this product, I would still buy and try it in the future! This honestly would‚Äôve been the most perfect size for my little one bedroom apartment and I‚Äôm really sad to say I don‚Äôt think I want to try paying more for a brand new one considering the reviews that it may end up going out in six months or a year.I have JBL portable speakers that are still going strong and they at least go strong for 2 1/2 years and they cost a third of the price!",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,4,Black,2023-07-22,4,"Good quality soundI thought I would give this speaker a try since I play guitar and love marshall amps. Overall great quality and sounds great. I've been very happy with it however, I feel like for the price it should be louder. I know there are cheaper speakers that get louder than this one, but even then at max volume it sounds great and doesn't become distorted like some other speakers would. So for the price it has great sound quality just not as loud as you would think.",True
Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,2,Black,2023-09-02,4,Sound qualityThe sound quality of this speaker is phenomenal. The only drawback of the speaker is how quiet it can be. I find myself wishing for more out of the speaker. Performs excellently and is very durable. Connectivity is rock solid all the way up to the advertised range.

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,0,Black,2023-12-03,2,"Bass is awfulGave it a shot. It has a very warm sound however that's drowned out by the ""punchy"" bass. I bought this because it was relatively low in volume and I didn't need much of a space to fill with sound. However, the bass is atrocious. Bass is meant to be felt not heard and all i hear is someone trying to punch my ear drums with every song. I do have tinitus so i can be sensitive to bass however the Stockwell 2 just slams it at you even with low volume and bass dial all the way down. Build quality and look is fantastic, i wish it worked out because of that. But I have heard other Marshall speakers in stores and they were all Bass over clarity. Hopefully they can come out with something with a more neutral sound, clarity, and no horrible ""punchy bass"". I'll be looking out for that speaker and first in line for it!",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,1,Black,2021-03-01,5,"Review from and actual dude (not a bot account)So I just got my Stockwell II today and let me tell you guys, it‚Äôs really awesome. I love the retro design and the weight and feel of the thing is just cool. I don‚Äôt typically write reviews but this little speaker has inspired me. And did I mention the sound quality? By FAR the best I‚Äôve ever heard from a portable Bluetooth speaker. And the little bass and treble nobs on top are very useful. The build of the speaker is very sturdy and rugged (and water resistance). I had the speaker for less than an hour before I got online to buy another one. But I finally decided to wait a couple of months and see if it passes the test of time. If it does, I‚Äôm definitely buying another one.",True
Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,1,Black,2021-03-23,5,"Happy with this!Sweet rich sound. The manual adjustable bass and treble is noticeable. Perfect to carry and travel with. Beautiful with or without the vegan leather strap, though I love it attached. This little speaker packs a punch. As far as volume goes, it‚Äôs a loud speaker for sure when turned all the way up in conjunction with your phone volume although I don‚Äôt usually even need the audio to be that loud, though for the size I love this thing! I also got an Emberton, so for anyone thinking about comparing the two, it‚Äôs notable that both will obviously be different in sound characteristics in some ways due to form factor and components, although it‚Äôs more the form factor/components and price that should really make the difference in choice because otherwise they both really -sound- great.",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,1,Black,2024-03-27,1,"Battery Charging IssueThe first sign that there's a problem with the Stockwell II is the fact that it took me over 10 tries to do a Bluetooth pairing before it finally paired. Then, the speaker needed a charge after using it 4 times...Stockwell II should have a full charge after 5 hours. However, after charging it for 5 hours, the battery indicator sat unbudged at 3 bars, and the indicator light would not blink as it should. I charged it for another 2 hours, and the battery indicator still showed 3 bars, the indicator never blinked.

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,2,Black,2022-12-07,1,"Only used one week then it would not charge again.I bought a Marshall Stockwell II portable Bluetooth speaker from Amazon (ordered on July 12, 2022.) Upon receiving it, I charged it overnight and used it in my office for over a week on the same charge. But then I couldn‚Äôt find the charger and did not use it for about two months. In November, I found the original box in my office closet and the charger was inside (yay!) so I connected it ‚Äî but it did not charge up. Over the next couple weeks, I tried again with two different charging blocks but it still didn‚Äôt charge, even over night. Today I contacted Amazon to ask if customer support could help me fix or replace it. They talked me through some troubleshooting (cleaning the charge port, resetting it, etc.) but nothing has helped. Now Amazon wants to charge a restocking fee to send it back, which seems unfair. I want to fix or replaceme it and it should still be under warranty since it‚Äôs less than 5 months old and worked perfectly when it first arrived. There‚Äôs no reason it shouldn‚Äôt last longer than that. It hasn‚Äôt been abused in any way ‚Äî it just sat in my desk without power for a couple months. Is that something that could cause damage? Can Marshall help me fix or replace this little speaker under warranty?",True

Marshall Stockwell II,149.99,0,Black,2022-05-05,5,"The best bluetooth speaker I've ever hadI bought this on sale for Prime Day two and a half years ago and it has been truly amazing. Being able to adjust the treble/bass is awesome for listening to different types of music. The sound feels so true and rich. It is portable and the little handle is awesome, but be aware it is very dense. It's not light but it is small and to me, that is not a downside but this isn't the sort of speaker you'd want to hang from a backpack and walk around with all day.The battery life is insane. I will actually go months between charging it with regular use. There was some review I read before buying this that said the volume control style (not a 1 to 1 increase in sound for how you turn the knob, it's exponential instead so the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the turning doesn't do much but any tweaking in the last 1/3 of the dial does a TON to change the volume) takes a lot less power than ""regular"" volume control and that's part of what makes the battery life so great. If I had to guess, I would say I've charged this speaker less than 10 times over two and a half years.I don't think I'll ever get a different brand of bluetooth speaker than Marshall after how amazing this has been.
